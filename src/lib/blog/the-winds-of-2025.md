  A New Year is upon and we all know what that means, no more bad habits till at least
  <Tooltip>
    <span slot="main">March</span>
    <span slot="hover">Okay at least February</span>
  </Tooltip>.
  Here’s my Top Ten New Years Resolution so far:
</p>

1. Start reading more
2. Learn the Keytar
3. Pick my nose less
4. Stop procrastinating

<p>
  I’d finish but I’ve recently been reading
  <Tooltip>
    <span slot="main">The Song of Fire and Ice</span>
    <span slot="hover">Did you know they made Game of Thrones into books?!</span>
  </Tooltip>
  series and needless to say I’ve been enthralled. I’ve read all five books and have loved
  every minute of it until the last book ends on a goddamn cliffhanger! And the author,
  George R.R. Martin, has been writing the next book in the series for
  <Tooltip>
    <span slot="main">fifteen years!</span>
    <span slot="hover">How hard is it to write down what happened in the T.V. show?</span>
  </Tooltip>
  Also, George R.R. Martin is super old! No one really knows how old because when you
  ask him, he says he’ll get back to you BUT HE NEVER DOES!
</p>

## we.are.all.going.to.die!

<p>
  … Someday. Even the semi-eternal writing machine
  that is George R.R. Martin. I say it’s time to pass

    <span slot="main">the torch!</span>
    <span slot="hover">If you don’t have one George I found this flamethrower
      branded as a torch online, you’re welcome!</span>
  </Tooltip>
  I implore that someone else be brought in to help Mr. Martin preserve his legacy, someone
  to provide the community with never-ending hope, someone who will continue to not write
  the next book
  <Tooltip>
    <span slot="main">The Winds of Winter</span>
    <span slot="hover">You gave it a name, now give it words.</span>
  </Tooltip>
  and who better than yours truly?
</p>

<p>
  Why me you might ask? I have years of experience, being a the prime age of 36 I have 36
  years of experience not finishing the book The Winds of Winter. And at this rate I could
  easily continue not finishing The Winds of Winter for at least 40 years. More generally,
  I am an expert procrastinator, I almost never finish anything. I certainly
  <Tooltip>
    <span slot="main">start things</span>
    <span slot="hover">Being able to start things really isn’t my strong suit either as my last blog post was over 2 years ago.</span>
  </Tooltip>
  but finishing things has been

    <span slot="main">a lot less interesting</span>
    <span slot="hover">I always leave the last two bites of my sandwich unfinished on principle.</span>
  </Tooltip>.
</p>

<p>
  On top of my ability not to finish things, I am also experienced in
  <Tooltip>
    <span slot="main">reading and writing</span>
    <span slot="hover">Who’s illiterate now 3rd grade teacher!</span>
  </Tooltip>
  and I know how to tease readers with excerpts.

## spare.the.chapter.spoil.the.book

Here is a taste of a teaser I would write, but before that for those of you who haven’t read the books yet here is a quick recap.

<SpoilerAlert />

<p>
  Brandon Stark, known as Bran, is a weird three eyed freak who can’t walk
  and sees the past by talking to birds. Additionally he also has dark hair and
  that is why he is known as the Three Eyed Raven. He lives in a cave in the
  frozen tundra with a giant simpleton named Hodor who carries Bran around and
  might chew and regurgitate food into Bran’s mouth like a mother bird. Hodor also
  does DJ sets in his spare time under the name DJ Hodor. Bran also lives with a
  swamp girl who I forget

    <span slot="main">the name</span>
    <span slot="hover">I’ll look it up later jeez, do I have to do everything myself?</span>

## that's.all.folks

That’s all you get… for now! But more will come as soon as my demands are met. Here is my list of top ten demands:

1. Full creative control over the Game Of Thrones universe
2. Two Billion dollars in Monopoly money
3. A pool full of nice sharks that have signed legal documents not to eat me
4. Constipation medicine
5. An assistant to finish the rest of this list...

All I need now is get this to the attention of George R.R. Martin. I know he lives somewhere in Nevada,
or was it New Mexico... Ehhh, I'll look it up later. I'm sure the assistant will come soon, they'll be
right on it.
