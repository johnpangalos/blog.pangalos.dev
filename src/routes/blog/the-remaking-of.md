# the.remaking.of

<p>
  Wow, it's been a while since I posted, hold on let me just check how long...
  IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR?! I guess time flies when you're not writing a blog.
  Well, there's a very good reason why I haven't posted in so long,
  <Tooltip>
    <span slot="main">I'M OUT OF IDEAS!</span>
    <span slot="hover">
      Oh and I'm out of toilet paper, I should go get some when I'm out picking
      up some ideas.
    </span>
  </Tooltip>
  Time to do the oldest trick in the book... REMAKE!
</p>

<p>
  Remakes are all the rage these days.
  <Link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King_(2019_film)"><i>The Lion King</i></Link>
  was remade in 2019. <i>GhostBusters</i> was 
  <Link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters_(2016_film)">remade in 2016</Link>
  and 
  <Link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostbusters:_Afterlife">then rebooted in 2021.</Link>
  Even
  <Link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lake_House_(film)"><i>The Lake House</i> was a remake,</Link>
  yes the movie where Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock
  send love letters through time was actually a remake of a Korean movie made in
  2000 called 
  <Tooltip>
  <span slot="main"><i>Il Mare.</i></span>
  <span slot="hover">
    Why does a Korean movie have an Italian name? Who cares! With a plot this good
    they could have called it Puddle Shack, have it star Nick Cage and Adam Sandler in
    wig and have it be directed by M. Night Shamawhatever and it would still make a million dollars...
    Wait, is that alot? Doesn't matter, they did it for the art.
  </span>
  </Tooltip> Let's watch the trailer for that shall we...

  </Tooltip>
  Well, if the it works for <i>The Lake House</i>, it will work for me too. The only question now is
  what's my gimmick?
</p>

## list.of.gimmicks

  <li>Replace me with someone younger and better looking.</li>

## still.starving

<p>
In the end I decided to try using
<Tooltip>
  <span slot="main">Svelte,</span>
  <span slot="hover">Still means starving, still super cool!</span>
</Tooltip>
something I've gushed at length about <Link to="/blog/looking-svelte">before.</Link>
Specifically I decided to use an SSR framework powered by Svelte called SvelteKit.
That statement might leave you with a few questions, like
</p>

- What's an "SSR framework"?
- Why does "tech" have so many "acronyms"?
- "WHY" "DON'T" "PEOPLE" "USE" "MORE" "QUOTATION" "MARKS"?

<p>
First off, calm down. We all love quotation marks, but we should do everything in moderation.
You wouldn't eat too much ice cream
<Tooltip>
  <span slot="main">would you?</span>
  <span slot="hover">My stomach hurts.</span>
</Tooltip>
Second, you have to learn
<Tooltip>
  <span slot="main">yet <i>another</i> acronym.</span>
  <span slot="hover">Oh God no, not another acronym!</span>
</Tooltip>
</p>

<NerdAlert />

<p>
Acronyms are just like scoops of ice cream, 
<Tooltip>
  <span slot="main">one more wont hurt!</span>
  <span slot="hover">Why?! No more, I'm gonna vommit!</span>
</Tooltip>
The technology that my blog uses is called SSR, but before we try and 
understand that, we'll have to understand a bit about how websites work.
</p>

## Â¿what.is.a.website?

<p>
You ever hear of a little something called 
<Tooltip>
  <span slot="main">"the internet"?</span>
  <span slot="hover">
    Gah! No more quotes, not even for sarcasm. Give the reader some credit!
  </span>
</Tooltip>
The internet, in simplest terms, is a way to access files on computers that 
aren't yours. If you want to see watch
<Link to="https://www.youtube.com/c/unboxtherapy">a person open boxes,</Link> 
<Link to="https://bookriot.com/harry-potter-erotica/">
  read some erotic Harry Potter fanfiction,
 </Link>
<Link to="https://cats.pangalos.dev">or look at some cat pictures from some weirdo,</Link>
the internet has it all. In reality, all of these are just files from computers 
somewhere out there in the world, be it text, pictures or videos.
</p>

<p>
But not every computer can be accessed by the internet, for that you have to open the
<Tooltip>
  <span slot="main">door to the internet.</span>
  <span slot="hover">
    It's like the door to Hell, if Hell was filled with annoying jerks who do
    things like harass women on Twitter, and Instagram, and Facebook, and Reddit
    and... oh my God, the internet sucks.
  </span>
</Tooltip>
This is not something that happens with normal computers, instead programmers
use special computers called <i>servers</i>. A <i>server</i> just waits around
for someone on the internet to ask a file. Then the <i>server</i>
<Tooltip>
  <span slot="main"><i>"serves"</i></span>
  <span slot="hover">
    Why did I do that? You had to have understood the connection there, right?
    RIGHT?!... I think I have a problem. And the solution? More quotation marks!
    Here, enjoy: """""""""""""""
  </span>
</Tooltip>
the file to the requester. These requests can come from any sort of
application, but in the case of a website, it most often comes from your browser.
</p>

<p>
But websites aren't just text, pictures and videos, that are on can have cool 
features like 
<Tooltip>
  <span slot="main">dark mode.</span>
  <span slot="hover">Remember this, we'll get back to it later.</span>
</Tooltip>
 That's where your web browser comes in. Your web browser downloads some 
 files, interprets them to displays a website.
</p>

## okay.so.what's.the.acronym

<p>
Okay now that we understand the internet and browsers, let's try a hypothetical. Let's say
you're an
<Tooltip>
  <span slot="main">intrepid young-ish blogger</span>
  <span slot="hover">Somewhere between 30 and 80 years old.</span>
</Tooltip>
and you wanted to make a blog from scratch, what are your options. The main 
options you'd have to choose from are these:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Client side rendering:</b> This is where your web browser takes code from
    a server and then generates a website before your very eyes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Server side rendering:</b> SSR for those of you that like acronyms,
    this is where your website is generated on server and then sent to your
    browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Static site generation:</b>
    <Link to="/blog/the-making-of">
      Which I wrote another blog entry about,
    </Link>
    is where all the pages on a website are pre-generated and are sent from a 
    server to your web browser.
  </li>
  <li>
    <Tooltip>
      <span slot="main">Ask someone younger for help</span>
      <span slot="hover">
        While you're at it, might as well ask them how to log into your email. 
        Don't forget to forget your password!
      </span>
    </Tooltip>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Some of you may be thinking, why would I ever
<Tooltip>
  <span slot="main"><i>not</i> pre-generate all of my site,</span>
  <span slot="hover">
    And why aren't my children answering my calls, I've unplugged my
    router again and for some reason Netflix isn't working.
  </span>
</Tooltip>
it sounds faster. Well, you're right, it certainly would be faster to not have 
to generate a page when a user asks for it. It is in fact how I originally made 
my blog, but there was only one issue with that... dark mode.
</p>

## let.there.be.dark

So what was the issue with my beloved dark mode on my old website? Well, if you
were to go to my old website and turn on dark mode and reload the page, what
would you see?

<video height="403.52px" src="/see.mp4" controls>
  <track kind="captions">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<p>
  Did you see it? Dear God, 
  <Tooltip>
    <span slot="main">THE HORROR!</span>
    <span slot="hover">
      But seriously, did you see it? People keep telling me "It's no big deal" 
      and "I'm crazy" and I keep telling them STOP USING QUOTATION MARKS! YOU'RE
      WORSE THAN THE SLIGHT FLICKER ON MY OLD WEBSITE!
    </span>
  </Tooltip>
  What was happening there to cause that awful flicker? For this we're going 
  to need some arrows.
</p>

<div class="flex flex-col font-bold font-mono text-center py-8">
  <div>
  Browser asks for file from server
  </div>
  <div>
  &darr;
  </div>
  <div>
  Server sends file to the browser 
  </div>
  <div>
  &darr; 
  </div>
  <div>
  Website appears in light mode
  </div>
  <div>
  &darr; 
  </div>
  <div>
  Website appears in dark mode 
  </div>
</div>

<div class="text-sm italic text-center pb-6">
  The order of how the website appears in dark mode in my old website
</div>

<p>
So what's the issue here? The issue is that the website is showing up before
we have what's necessary to show the page in dark mode. So instead of going
directly to dark mode, we end up having to use this 
<Tooltip>
  <span slot="main">in-between state.</span>
  <span slot="hover">
    It's like whatever the evolutionary step is between the PokÃ©mon Squirtle 
    and Blastoise. I don't know and I don't want to know... Seriously don't 
    tell me, I will be physically and purposefully ill.
  </span>
</Tooltip>
</p>

How do we fix this egregious error? One way is to know what mode you're in before
you send the files from the server to the browser, like some sort of computer
Nostradamus. And how do we know this?

## c.is.for.tracking

<p>
What I use to make dark mode work in this website is the  
<Link to="https://truthinadvertising.org/articles/facebooks-tracking-cookies/">
  same technology that Facebook uses to track all of your internet browsing,
</Link>
and it's called a cookie. What is a cookie you might ask? It's a bit of
text that is saved in you browser and is used to communicate with servers
to let them know you're logged in, and in this website's case it's used to save
if you're using dark mode. Our new arrow diagram looks like this:
</p>

<div class="flex flex-col font-bold font-mono text-center py-8">
  <div>
  Browser asks for a file from server with cookie
  </div>
  <div>
  &darr;
  </div>
  <div>
  Server reads cookie and sees it's in dark mode
  </div>
  <div>
  &darr; 
  </div>
  <div>
  Server generates site in dark mode
  </div>
  <div>
  &darr; 
  </div>
  <div>
  Server sends file to the Browser
  </div>
  <div>
  &darr; 
  </div>
  <div>
  Website appears in dark mode 
  </div>
</div>

<div class="text-sm italic text-center pb-6">
  The order of how the website appears in dark mode now
</div>

Even though there are more steps now, it doesn't take significantly longer
for the website to show up.

## conclusion

<p>
By switching to using SSR instead of pre-generating my site I have fixed the 
problem of having light mode show up briefly on refresh, and it only took over 
a year to make! Well, at least 
<Tooltip>
  <span slot="main">we learned something.</span>
  <span slot="hover">
    Oh my god, a Squirtle evolves into a Wartortle? Why not Warturtle? It sounds like

    I need to be purposefully sick now...
